# 2048Game
A game i did for a school project with one of my friend. We used the SFML library for that. Done in C++

Here are the most important files.
If you wanna try the game by yourself, you should download and setup the SFML library.

Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 64-bit for visual studio was used

It's clearly not perfect yet, there are still many adjustments to do (creating softer movements for the tiles, debugging some things, or even just making it look better)
Anyway, it's still under development. It should be finalised around late june / early july.
